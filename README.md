# SnakeGame-(in-Progress)

I am teaming up with my schoolmate Aidan Bird, to create the Snake Game using the technologies: JavaScript,HTML, CSS and BootStrap.

We have almost completed 75% of the game where we can move the head of the snake and also can create the Food for the snake at random places in the Game Screen.

All we have left to do is:  1.)End the game if Snake collides with itself or with the wall. 2.) Increment the score whenever Snake consumes the food.
